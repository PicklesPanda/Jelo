    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Pickles and I am one of the founders of Jelopolous, as well as the Head of Crea-search. My assistant researcher, Dreek, is a great help to me in discovering and observing creatures on Jelopolous, but I write up most of the reports, which are stored here on this website. My favourite species we have studied so far is the pou. I am in the process of learning to code better, and I hope to one day be able to develop some Jelopolous-themed games I can put up on this site.</p>
