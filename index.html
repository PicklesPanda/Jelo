    <p>Out of Noirenia <br> And in through the mind <br> Push through your thoughts <br> And you will find <br> A planet, a kingdom <br> The size of your hand <br> So venture forth     <br> And discover new lands <br> Close your eyes <br> And drift away <br> After a while <br> You'll want to stay <br> Free the creatures <br> Research each of their features <br> And don't dareth grieve <br> The fact that you'll never, ever <br> be able to leave <br></p>
